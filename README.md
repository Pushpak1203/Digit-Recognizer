Python project to recognize digits from (0-9) using machine learning using Tensorflow, NumPy, Tkinter and Pillow (PIL).  Make sure create a "Virtual Environment" before starting the python project. 









Note: While doing any pyhton project, it is necessary to create a virtual enivironment. By creating a virtual environment, the modules which you are using in a project, there might be possibility that you have used the same modules in some other project, the virtual environment helps to create an environment which completely isolated from system environment.

To create a virtual environmnet: if you are doing this project in Microsoft Visual Studio code, then open command prompt in VS Code terminal and give these commands to activate virtual environment:

pip instal virtualenv

virtualenv name of your env (ex: python -m venv myenv)<--- Here myenv is the name of the virtual environment, you can give as per your wish

activate your virtual environment: myenv\Scripts\activate (this command as per the example, you give any name to your virtualenv, but make sure that while you are activating the virtualenv mention the same name which you have given while creating the virtualenv)

after virtualenv is active, install the required libraries by using pip install __________(name of the library) in VS Code terminal CMD(for example: pip install tensorflow)




Note: Tensorflow is only supported for the python verions from 3.8 to 3.11.9.
So, check your python version before executing this project.
